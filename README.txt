Write a function:
class Solution { public string solution(string S, string T); }
that given two string S and T consisting of N and M characters, respectively,
determines whether string T can be obtained from string S by at most one simple operation
from the set specified below.
The function should return a string:
	● "INSERT c" if string T can be obtained from string S by inserting a single character "c";
	● "REPLACE c d" if string T can be obtained from string S by replacing a single occurrence of
		character "c" with a single character "d" (these characters should be distinct);
	● "SWAP c d" if string T can be obtained from string S by swapping two adjacent  characters "c"
		and "d" (these characters should be distinct and in the order as is string S exactly one swap is
		performed);
	● "EQUAL" if no operation is needed (strings T and S are equal);
	● "IMPOSSIBLE" if none of the above works.
Note that by characters "c" and "d" from the operation above, we mean any English alphabet
lowercase letters.
For example:
	● given S = "nice" and T = "niece", the function should return "INSERT e";
	● given S = "test" and T = 'tent', the function  should return "REPLACE s n";
	● given S = "form" and T = 'from', the function should return "SWAP o r";
	● given S = "o" and T = "odd", the function should return "IMPOSSIBLE".
Assume that:
	● N and M are integers within the range [1..100];
	● string S can contain any character
	● string T can contain any character
